    <faq id="name1">
      <question>
        How can I help write documentation?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This project uses <link href="ext:forrest">Apache
          Forrest</link> to generate documentation from XML.  Please
          download a copy of Forrest, which can be used to <link
          href="ext:forrest/validation">validate</link>, <link
          href="ext:forrest/webapp">develop</link> and render a
          project site.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          The source for the site is in the WSRP4J CVS tree under site/build/src/content/xdocs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever the site is changed, forrest is executed to generate it.  
          The output of the forrest build is committed to the
          ws-site/targets/wsrp4j CVS tree.  Every 24 hours, the contents
          of ws-site gets published to the web.

    <faq id="name2">
      <question>How can I configure my own consumable portlets?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You can achieve this through the producer component. You'll have to
          implement your own JSR-168 portlet and then make it accesible through
          the WSRP4J producer.
        </p>

          directions.

    <faq id="plutoportal">
      <question>
        Can I use PlutoPortal/another portal to consume remote portlets?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes, you can use it. Theoretically you can use whichever portal
          environment you like most, but PlutoPortal is the only tested by the
          WSRP4J team. We know there are successful efforts integrating
          ProxyPortlet with other portal environments, but they (still) aren't
          officially supported.
