    <section><title>Running the SwingConsumer</title>

      <p>Start the Producer by starting Tomcat, if it's not already running.</p>
      <p>Run the TCPMonitor program by running the following maven command:</p>
      <source>
      maven tunnel
      </source>
      <p>
      The tunnel defaults to listening on port 8081 and sending to
      port 8080.  The SwingConsumer sends to port 8081 by default.
      Note that you can also alter the relevant ports once the
      TCPMonitor is started.
      </p>
      <p>
      Run the SwingConsumer by executing the following maven command:
      </p>
      <source>
      maven run-swingconsumer
      </source>
    </section>
    <section><title>Changing the SwingConsumer's Producer URL</title>
    <p>
    The SwingConsumer stores persistent files in the
    wsrp4j/consumer-swingconsumer/target/persistence directory.  In
    the producers subdirectory, edit the file named:
    org.apache.wsrp4j.commons.consumer.driver.ProducerImpl@WSRP4J.xml
    and change all the URLs.
