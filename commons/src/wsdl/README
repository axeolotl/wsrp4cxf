There are different versions of them, these are from dates:

wsrp_v1_types.xsd: 30 Jun 2003
wsrp_v1_interfaces.wsdl: 27 Jun 2003
wsrp_v1_bindings.wsdl: 27 Jun 2003
wsrp_service.wsdl: 17 Apr 2003

wsrp_service.wsdl sets up the endpoints of wsrp communication. It includes
the address for communication, but that address is only used as a default
endpoint; if there are other endpoints supplied to ServiceLocator class
(generated class that follows service locator pattern), that ones will be used
instead.

The file NoStoPkg.properties specifies a translation between xml namespaces
and Java package names for the generated classes.
