!!! WSRP4J Project Incubation Status

This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise.
For more general project status, look on the project [website|http://portals.apache.org/wsrp4j/].

!!! Description

The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 1.0 Producer. WSRP is an OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be accessed remotely using Web Services.

!!! News

	* We developed Google Summer of Code proposal for a chunk of new features we have a	student ready to implement them.
	* We voted to move to Subversion and Maven.
	* We have received contributions from outside developers, which we hope grows into more diverse participation.
	* I (jmacna@apache.org) have met with constituents from higher education that are using WSRP4J and see a strong role for WSRP in their software plans, and I have encouraged them to contribute to the project publicly.  We have seen increased participation from these teams already.

! Project specific 

''Add project specific tasks here.''

!! Incubation 

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.

'' These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation.  ''
'' They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff.  ''

! Collaborative Development

	Yes
* Are there three or more independent committers?
